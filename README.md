# Setup Blynk:

Make sure you have Blynk app installed and have created an account, login to it and select **New Project**.

You can choose whatever name you want, I would suggest 'workshop_NodeMCU_1'.

In **devices** choose **ESP8266**. In connection type choose **Wi-Fi**. Extra you can choose the app theme as you prefer.

The next message you'll receive is one saying:

> *"Auth Token was sent to: the@email.com"*

this Auth token will be the one telling your dev kit to connect to your Blynk app.

Let's explore the app created a little more, do not make any changes, just click the options on top (**Settings, Add Widget Box, Run**).
